## Light Bulb Challenge
- As a user, I can see a square on the screen with the word off in the middle.
- As a user, when I click the square the word toggle from "off" to "on" and then back "off" again.
- As a user, when I click the box the color goes from white to yellow. The words "on" or "off" are still displayed in the box.
- As a user, instead of seeing a box, I see a picture of a light switch in the "off" position.
- As a user, when I click on the light switch it turns "on".
- As a user, when the light switch is "off", I see a white light bulb.
- As a user, when I turn the switch "on", I see a yellow light bulb.

**Stretch Challenge**
- As a user, I can see two buttons: 1) Add a Light Switch and 2) Remove a Light Switch.
- As a user, when I click the Add button I can another Light Switch with its accompanying Light Bulb.
- As a user, when I see multiple Light Switch/Light Bulb combinations, they all operate independently of each other.
- As a user, when I click the Remove button I can delete a Light Switch with its accompanying Light Bulb.
