# Apartment App Challenge

As a developer, I have been commissioned to create an application where a user can see apartments that are available for rent. As a user, I can see a list of apartments. I can click on an apartment listing and see more information about that apartment. As a user, I can create an account and log in to the application. If I am logged in, I can add an apartment to the list. As a logged in user, I can see a list of all the apartments as well as just the apartments I added. If my work is acceptable to my client, I may also be asked to add the ability to remove an apartment from the list as well as edit the apartment information.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Did you create your database?
- Did you migrate?
- Errors? Always look at the first error in the list.


## User Stories
**Story:** As an un-registered guest on the website, I can go to a web page and see a list of available apartments. Apartments have: a street designation, a city, state, a manager's name, manager's contact email, monthly rental price, bedrooms, bathrooms, and whether they allow pets

**Story:** As an un-registered guest on the website, I can click on an apartment to view its details

**Story:** As an un-registered guest on the website, I can see a header element at the top of each page containing navigation to the other pages

**Story:** As a un-registered guest, I can go to registration page with a form and register as a new user

**Story:** As a registered user who has not logged in, I can go to a login page

**Story:** As a logged in user, I should be able to log out

**Story:** As a logged in user, I can go to a new apartment page with a form and create a new apartment

**Story:**: As a logged in user, I can edit the information for any apartment I have created, but I cannot edit the information for apartments that belong to someone else




## Process
#### Challenge 1 - Planning
- Draw out a proposed database schema
- What tables do you anticipate you will need?
- What associations do your tables have?
- Explore some of the free Bootstrap themes available, which one do you want to use?
- Wireframe the main pages in the application.
- What forms will you need?
- What fields are on those forms?
- Do your forms match your database schema?
- What are the user flows?
- Protected vs. unprotected pages?
- What is the most important user flow of the application?
- Is this flow easy and intuitive for the user?
#### Challenge 2 - Authentication
- Implement your authentication code, with stubbed out main pages
#### Challenge 3 - Main UI
- Implement your main UI pages in your single page application
- Use data mocks to work with real data, but without the complexity of API integration
#### Challenge 4 - API
- Finish off your application by hooking up the Database via API endpoints
- Is everything secure?
