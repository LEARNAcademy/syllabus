# Cat Tinder Demos

#### Overview

As a developer, you will need to be able to present your code and talk about the work you do. Demos can be challenging. Take at least 30 min to plan and practice with your partner.

Pro tip: Decide ahead of time who will be screen sharing during your demo and if it will be necessary to swap.
