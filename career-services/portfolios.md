# Portfolio

#### Overview

A portfolio is a website where, as a developer, you can showcase your work and represent your individual brand. Portfolios are especially important for career transitioners as they function as a stand-in for professional experience. It is an opportunity to show off your skills, talents, and interests in development. Portfolios provide more personalization than your resume and give you an opportunity to share your story with future employees.

### Portfolio Options

There are many tech options to consider when creating your portfolio. Portfolios are a great opportunity to explore new tech stacks. Listed below are some options for low-code, no-code, or template portfolios.

- Quick one-page sites with [Carrd](https://carrd.co/)
- No-code sites with [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) React framework
- [HTML5 Up](https://html5up.net/) template sites
- [Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/themes) templates and themes

It can feel overwhelming for new developers to learn another technology in addition to your coursework at LEARN. There is nothing wrong with a simple approach. Don't let the complications of coding get in the way of you telling your story and displaying your work.

To help streamline the process, we recommend choosing either HTML and CSS or React.

### Deploying HTML and CSS GitHub Pages

This option is great for HTML and CSS portfolios. GitHub offers every member one special repository that can be hosted for free by GitHub. This is a great place to host your portfolio site. If you ever want to use GitHub's special repository to host something else, you can move your portfolio to a different repository. Read all about GitHub Pages [here](https://pages.github.com).

Follow the instructions **exactly!**

- You must have a file named `index.html`
- The name of your repository must be `your-username.github.io`
- Put your code in this repository - no nested files!

### Deploy Via Render

This option is great for static React applications. [Render.com](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app) will connect to your GitHub repository and build your application with just a couple of commands. Follow the instructions in the documentation.
