### Cover Letters

40% of employers say cover letters are the most important part of the job application. Statistically, hiring managers spend about a minute looking at an applicant's resume and cover letter. Often the person reviewing resumes is not a technical person so cover letters give the applicant an opportunity to explain why they are a good fit for the role. Cover letters can be the deciding factor between candidates.

Cover letters give you the ability to be more engaging than allowed within a resume structure. Cover letters should align the company values with an applicant's experience.

Provide a quick explanation of:

- HOW you fit the role?
- WHY you’re interested in the
  position/company?
- WHAT about your prior experience and skills fulfills the job description?

Think of your resume, cover letter, and job application as your first assignments for the company that you’re interested in joining. Cover letters should engaging, inviting and filled with enough information about the skills that a recruiter or hiring manager would want to know more about you.
