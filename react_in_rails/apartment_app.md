## Process
#### Challenge 1 - Planning
- Draw out a proposed database schema
- What tables do you anticipate you will need?
- What associations do your tables have?
- Explore some of the free Bootstrap themes available, which one do you want to use?
- Wireframe the main pages in the application.
- What forms will you need?
- What fields are on those forms?
- Do your forms match your database schema?
- What are the user flows?
- Protected vs. unprotected pages?
- What is the most important user flow of the application?
- Is this flow easy and intuitive for the user?
#### Challenge 2 - Authentication
- Implement your authentication code, with stubbed out main pages
#### Challenge 3 - Main UI
- Implement your main UI pages in your single page application
- Use data mocks to work with real data, but without the complexity of API integration
#### Challenge 4 - API
- Finish off your application by hooking up the Database via API endpoints
- Is everything secure?
