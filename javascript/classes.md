# JavaScript Classes

#### Overview

Classes are the blueprint or templates for objects. Classes are reusable and customizable, much like functions.

#### Process

- `cd` into the `javascript-foundations-challenges` repository
- Create a new branch: `classes-initials1-initials2` (ex. classes-aw-sp)
- `touch` a file with no spaces and `.js` extension: `classes-student1-student2.js` (ex. classes-austin-sarah.js)
- Open the folder in a text editor
- Code!

### Classes

Classes are a particular type of function that contain data and behavior. Classes are the blueprints of objects. Just like functions, classes have their own scope.

There are particular JavaScript keywords that are used to create and access information within a class:

- **constructor:** a special method for creating and initializing objects
- **this:** a JavaScript keyword that refers to the object it belongs to
- **new:** used when creating a new instance of a class (an object)

Class syntax conventions:

- Class names are always capitalized
- Class names are PascalCased (like camelCase, but the first word is capitalized)
- Instance of classes (objects) are always lowercase

```javascript
class Squirrel {
  constructor() {
    this.nutCount = 0
  }

  storeNut() {
    this.nutCount += 1
  }

  eatNut() {
    this.nutCount -= 1
  }
}
// creating the instance of the class, saved as a variable
// rocky now has access to the class methods
const rocky = new Squirrel()

console.log(rocky.nutCount)
// output: 0

rocky.storeNut()
console.log(rocky.nutCount)
// output: 1

rocky.storeNut()
console.log(rocky.nutCount)
// output: 2

rocky.eatNut()
console.log(rocky.nutCount)
// output: 1
```

Just like functions, classes are reusable. Each object created from the class is independent from each other.

```javascript
class Squirrel {
  constructor() {
    this.nutCount = 0
  }

  storeNut() {
    this.nutCount += 1
  }

  eatNut() {
    this.nutCount -= 1
  }
}

const rocky = new Squirrel()
const alvin = new Squirrel()

alvin.storeNut()
alvin.storeNut()

console.log("Rocky has ", rocky.nutCount)
// output: "Rocky has 0"

console.log("Alvin has ", alvin.nutCount)
// output: "Alvin has 2"
```

Class instances can be used like any other 'thing' in JavaScript. We can rewrite the above like this:

```javascript
class Squirrel {
  constructor() {
    this.nutCount = 0
  }

  storeNut() {
    this.nutCount += 1
  }

  eatNut() {
    this.nutCount -= 1
  }
}
// create a new array
const squirrels = []
// pushes new squirrel objects into the array
squirrels.push(new Squirrel())
squirrels.push(new Squirrel())

// accessing the object at array index 0
squirrels[0].storeNut()
squirrels[0].storeNut()

// mapping over array to access the information from the squirrels array
squirrels.map((value, index) => {
  console.log(`The squirrel at index ${index} has ${value.nutCount} nuts.`)
})
```

Class instances can store any kind of data.

```javascript
class DiceRoller {
  constructor() {
    this.rolls = []
  }

  roll() {
    // generating a random number between 1 and 6 and pushing to the this.rolls array
    this.rolls.push(Math.ceil(Math.random() * 6))
  }

  lastRoll() {
    //logging the last roll added to the array
    return this.rolls[this.rolls.length - 1]
  }
}

const roller = new DiceRoller()
console.log("Roll:", roller.lastRoll())
// output: Roll: undefined

roller.roll()
console.log("Roll:", roller.lastRoll())
// output: Roll: 6

roller.roll()
console.log("Roll:", roller.lastRoll())
// output: Roll: 4

console.log("All Rolls:", roller.rolls)
// output: All Rolls: [ 6, 4 ]
```

The constructor method can take arguments. This creates objects with unique data.

```javascript
class Dog {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name
    this.age = age
  }

  description() {
    return `${this.name} is a ${this.age} year old dog.`
  }
}
// now when creating the new object, the constructor method is expecting two arguments: a name and an age
const rover = new Dog("Rover", 4)
console.log(rover.description())
// output: "Rover is a 4 year old dog."
```

We can use the Dog class to create many different dog objects with different properties.

```javascript
const plato = new Dog("Plato", 8)
const bella = new Dog("Bella", 11)

console.log(plato.description())
// output: "Plato is a 8 year old dog."

console.log(bella.description())
// output: "Bella is a 11 year old dog."
```

Objects are still just variables that reference a class. Variables in JavaScript can be reassigned.

```javascript
const plato = new Dog("Plato", 8)
const bella = new Dog("Bella", 11)

console.log(plato.description())
// output: "Plato is a 8 year old dog."

console.log(bella.description())
// output: "Bella is a 11 year old dog."
bella = plato
console.log(bella.description())
// output: "Plato is a 8 year old dog."
// !!!! bella got reassigned
```
