## Ternary Operator

Ternary operators are handy shortcuts for creating `if/else` statements in JavaScript. Ternary operators allow JavaScript developers to make very clean and concise code.

Consider the following program:

```javascript
const age = 20

if (age >= 16) {
  console.log("You are old enough to drive.")
} else {
  console.log("You are not old enough to drive.")
}
```

This code has exactly two possible outcomes which makes it a great candidate for refactoring using a ternary operator.

### Ternary Operator Anatomy

There are three parts of a ternary operator:

1. The condition that you are evaluating. The outcome of the evaluation should be a boolean value or coerce to a boolean value.
2. A question mark `?` that will separate the condition from the truthy outcome.
3. A `:` that will separate the truthy outcome from the falsey outcome.

Here is the refactor from the previous example:

```javascript
const age = 20

age >= 16
  ? console.log("You are old enough to drive.")
  : console.log("You are not old enough to drive.")
```

In pseudocode, this would read:

```
condition ? output if true : output if false
```

### Additional Examples

In this case, we are creating a function that will greet a user. If the user offers us a name we will greet the user by name. If not, we will offer a generic greeting.

```javascript
const greeter = (myName) => {
  return myName ? `Hey there, ${myName}` : "Hey there, you!"
}
console.log(greeter(null))
// output: "Hey there, you!"
console.log(greeter("LEARN Student"))
// output: "Hey there, LEARN Student"
```

Here we are creating a function that will determine if a light switch is on or off and instruct our user to perform an appropriate action.

```javascript
const toggler = (onOff) => {
  return onOff === "on" ? "Turn switch off." : "Turn switch on."
}
console.log(toggler("on"))
// output: "Turn switch off."
console.log(toggler("off"))
// output: "Turn switch on."
```

### ðŸ’» Challenges

- Create a function that determines if a user is old enough to vote (age 18 or older).
- Create a function that takes in an array of numbers and determines if the number is odd or even.
