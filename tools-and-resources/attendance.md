# Attendance Policy

We expect you to attend class in full, every day. With only four months together, we have a lot of ground to cover. Every day of class is important. In order to ensure a student gains the necessary knowledge and skills from the LEARN program, we require students to be present in class every day with no more than five (5) absences. 

Missing three or more hours of class will be logged as an absence. Missing any amount of class is considered a tardy. Three tardies will accumulate to be assessed as one absence.

We understand that life happens and you may have situations outside of your control that result in planned or unexpected absences during the course. Before missing any amount of class, please consider the following:
- Topics we cover in class build on each other. Any missed time may have negative repercussions for future lessons. The onus is on you to ensure you make up any material missed in class. The catch-up material should be seen by an instructor.
- We collaborate every single day in class, either by pair programming or in larger groups. Be conscientious towards your classmates by considering the impact on their learning if you are not in class.
- LEARN Academy students must be located in the United States while enrolled in our full-time program. Any student who leaves the country at any stage of their admission to LEARN Academy is required to notify LEARN Academy staff two weeks before departure. LEARN Academy reserves the right to remove students from the cohort if the departure was not communicated or approved. Each case is handled on an individual basis.  

### Your Responsibilities

Any time you are absent from class, it is required that you post in your cohort Slack channel informing the class and instruction team of your absence.

Planned Absences:  
Planned time away from class such as appointments or travel must be communicated to an instructor as soon as possible so arrangements can be made. Giving the instruction team ample notice will allow plans to be made to mitigate the impact of your absence for you and your cohort mates. Less than 24 hours advance notice for planned absences is unacceptable.

Unplanned Absences:  
If you are unable to attend class at short notice (due to illness, internet issues, etc.), you must inform an instructor as soon as possible. We recommend installing the Slack application on your phone for quick communication.

Tardiness:  
Class begins promptly. You should not be late. “Prompt arrival” also includes returning back to class on time from scheduled breaks. Any time away from regularly scheduled class time is considered a tardy.

### Consequences

LEARN Academy reserves the right to remove a student from the program if the student is not meeting program requirements. The student is responsible for understanding the requirements, asking questions if unsure, and holding themselves accountable for meeting all requirements.

LEARN Academy does not measure “excused” absences or “unexcused” absences. All absences are counted towards the maximum (5) allotted absences for each student. Any absences or missed class time that is not communicated will put the student at risk for removal from the program.

### Red Flags

Everyone at LEARN wants you to be successful. To this end, we will proactively communicate with you about your progress in class. We do our due diligence to watch for “red flags” and inform you if we feel you are in danger of not meeting program requirements. We will work with you to the best of our capabilities to help you meet the requirements.

A LEARN staff member will reach out if you
- reach three absences, and/or the equivalent accumulated tardies.
- are consistently late, leaving early, or missing class.
- are not present in Zoom, distracted, unengaged, or consistently turning off your camera.
- are not participating in the activities outlined by the program requirements.
- any other action or behavior we deem as a “red flag.”

Our goal at LEARN is to help people successfully transition into a career in the tech industry. We recognize the challenging nature of this program and will work hard to help you acquire all the necessary skills and knowledge. We will communicate proactively with you and expect you to do the same.
