# Attendance Requirements

The expectation for class attendance is that you are in class with your camera on for all sessions.

Class begins promptly. Students should not be late. It is disruptive and unprofessional to enter a class that is already underway. Prompt arrival also includes returning back to class on time from scheduled breaks.

Onus is on the student to catch up with any material missed in class.

### Tardies
We expect you to be on time.

You will be assessed as tardy:
- if you miss the morning check in.
- if you miss an hour or more of class during the day.

Three tardies will be assessed as an absence.


### Unexcused Absences
Anytime you are out of class and it is not communicated, your absence is considered unexcused. Any unexcused absence, missed class, or tardies will result in a conversation with an instructor.

Having Slack on your phone can be handy to communicate internet disruptions.


### Absences
Excessive absences are cause for removal from the class.

Before taking a time away from class, please consider:
- if the absence is essential.
- the impact on your learning for the days after your absence.
- the impact on othersâ€™ learning on the days you are absent.

Absences of any kind should be communicated to the instructors as soon as possible. Absences are naturally disruptive to the class. Early communication can help reduce disruptions.

On the day of the absence, students should post in the classroom Slack channel.

Notes about absences:
- Missing three hours or more of class is an absence for the day.
- Three tardies will be assessed as an absence.
- At three absences you will have a conversation with an instructor to evaluate your ability to continue with the class.
- At five assessed absences you will not continue with the class.
