# Atom Text Editor

Atom is a text and source code editor developed by Github. There are lots of great text editors, but at Learn we use Atom because it is free, open-sourced, and user friendly. Atom can be run from Mac, Windows, or Linux operating system and supports all the languages we use at Learn as well as Node.js integration, git control

Check out the README.md on Github for more information about and download instructions for <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom" target="_blank">Atom</a>. The <a href="https://flight-manual.atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom Flight Manual</a> is a great resource to familiarize yourself with Atom.

### Packages
Atom allows users the option to add third-party packages to add functionality and customized features and looks. These packages can be installed and managed via Atom's package manager (APM).

To download packages open Atom >> preferences >> install >> search


Checkout these options:
- Atom Beautify
- Bracket Matcher
- Spell Check

### Notes
Helpful tidbits:
- Toggle soft wrap - toggle on to end the line of code at the end of the screen view and wrap to the next line
- Split the screen top/bottom or left/right to view multiple files
- Change the colors and layouts in Atom >> preferences >> themes >> UI themes/Syntax themes


### Shortcuts
- highlight multiple lines `tab` to indent blocks of code
- `shift tab` out-dent  
- `command /` comments out code  
- `command l` selects the current line, holding 'command' and hitting `l` will add subsequent lines to the selected block  
- `command d` will find every instance of a word  
- `shift command d` duplicates the line  
- `command control up/down arrow` moves the line of code up or down
