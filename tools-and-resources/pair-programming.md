# Pair Programming

An important part of being successful in a remote dev team is effective pair programming.

### Why We Utilize Pair Programming
- Different people have different knowledge and strengths which can lead to better solutions
- Distributing cognitive load and use individualized skills (typing syntax vs. problem solving) when driving and navigating
- Coding can feel overwhelming, so focusing on one aspect of the job at hand can help focus energy on problem solving
- Two sets of eyes makes it easier to catch mistakes and produce high-quality code
- A pair can hold each other accountable so you'll be less likely to be tempted to take shortcuts or jump around without finishing the task you are on
- Partners help keep the focus on coding and not on distractions like texts, emails, etc
- Talking about your code with a partner will deepen your understanding of programming
- Increased specialization requires more collaboration

#### Roles: Driver and Navigator
The **driver** is the one with their hands on the keyboard. They are responsible for entering information and following the instructions given by the **navigator**. This approach requires constant communication. And talking about your code will make you a better developer and a better teammate. It is important to switch roles every 10-20 minutes and take frequent breaks.

#### Step 1: Getting Your Pair
Pairs or mobs will be determined by instructors.

#### Step 2: Planning
Once in the breakout room, take a few minutes to read through the necessary material. Make sure everyone on the team understands the full objective of the challenge. Discuss the technologies needed to accomplish the goal at hand. If the project has a larger scope, utilize wireframes in your planning session.

#### Step 3: Technology Set Up
After your team has decided on the technology to be used, select who will be the first driver and who will be the first navigator. With the navigators direction, the driver will share his/her screen and begin to code.
