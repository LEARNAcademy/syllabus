### Wireframes

Wireframes are often used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page. They create an agreed upon visual design for everyone on the team. A successful wireframe should give context to the developer without restricting design decisions that may evolve as the application grows.

The wireframe of a web application is a simplification of the view to illustrate the following:

- What information is needs to be displayed on a page.
- Where the information should be on the page.
- How the user will navigate through the page or the application.

As long as the idea you are trying to get across is clear and understandable, it's a successful wireframe.
