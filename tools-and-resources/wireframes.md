# Wireframing

A **wireframe** of a web application is a simplification of the view to illustrate three things:

* What and where information is shown
* What UI elements or widgets will be used (for instance, buttons vs. links)
* How to navigate the page or the site

Some wireframes look like they were drawn with a crayon by a three year old on the back of a napkin; these are called low-fidelity wireframes.
The point is to only create a visual guide and not get into too many details. As long as the idea you are trying to get across is clear and understandable, it's a successful wireframe.  You can use a whiteboard, paper, or whatever is convenient.

There are online tools to make wireframing as easy as possible, and shareable as well.

Wireframes can be higher-fidelity and attempt to create a truthful experience of how an application will work "in the wild". An Example: [ Balsamiq Mockups 3 Intro ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxWTGBQE7zE)
