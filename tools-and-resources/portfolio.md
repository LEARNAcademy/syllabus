### Portfolios

During professional development week, you will present what you have completed so far to your classmates. Your portfolio doesn't need to be completed but it does need to be in a presentable form. Below are a few resources to get started.

Portfolios can be a project that grows with you over time. It can become a perpetual side project that allows you to explore new technologies as you are ready for them.

Start off simple! HTML and CSS are all you need to create a great portfolio website. Don't let the complications of coding get in the way of you telling your story and displaying your work.

### Portfolio Timeline and Checklist

**Week 4**

- Create a wireframe for your portfolio.
  - [Figma](https://www.figma.com) is a great platform to create wireframes.
  - Check out the LEARN syllabus section on wireframes.
- Decide on which technologies to use.
- Code the basic layout with filler text and projects (UI without functionality).
  - [Lorem Ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/) can be used to fill in content that you will create during professional development week.

**Week 5**

- Create project cards with placeholder information.
- Create languages/frameworks/tech section with placeholder information.
- Consider a color/font scheme and branding.

**Week 6**

- Create page navigation functionality.
- Fill in project placeholder text with all projects so far.
- Activate links to projects. Links can direct users to a deployed site or your GitHub repo.
- Add any screenshots or gifs to project cards to show snippets of project functionality. This is great for projects like the text-based game.
- Deploy!

**Week 7**

- Activate links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and resume PDF.
- Fill in your elevator pitch copy.

### Deploying Via GitHub Pages

This option is great for HTML and CSS portfolios. GitHub offers every member one special repository that can be hosted for free by GitHub. This is a great place to host your portfolio site. If you ever want to use GitHub's special repository to host something else, you can move your portfolio to a different repository. Read all about GitHub Pages [here](https://pages.github.com).

Follow the instructions **exactly!**

- You must have a file named `index.html`
- The name of your repository must be `yourusername.github.io`
- Put your code in this repository - no nested files!

### Deploy Via Render

This option is great for static React applications. [Render.com](https://render.com/docs/deploy-create-react-app) will connect to your GitHub repository and build your application with just a couple commands. Follow the instructions in the documentation.
