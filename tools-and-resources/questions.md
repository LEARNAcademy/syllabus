# How to Ask a Tech Question

Coding is tough. You will run into problems and you will get stuck. Communicating the problem you are experiencing can be as big of a challenge as fixing the problem itself. Here are some helpful tips when you run into problems and get stuck.

### Before You Ask A Question
* Read the syllabus thoroughly. Look back at other sections that reference the syntax you are working with.

* Talk about your problem! One of the reasons we utilize pair-programming is to encourage communication about coding. If you are both stuck talk to the rubber duck.

* Pseudo coding is the term developers use for translating the code into sentence structure. This can help you create a step by step plan for your problem and a point of reference when you get stuck.

* Learn your programming vocabulary so can correctly identify the problem you are having.

* Double check your indentations and syntax. Use the built in functionality of the text editor to make sure all your tags, parentheses, and curly braces close.

* Typos are very common errors.

* Read your error messages! Errors are a great way to fix your code. Error messages will often contain the file and the line the error where the error occurred.

* Use dev tools and console.log to inspect the page and look for where your error occurs. Make sure the problem you think you have is actually the problem you have.

* Change one thing at a time, then test it, then make one more change, then test. It is easy to get down a rabbit hole with bug fixing.

### Asking A Question
* Give context. Explain what challenge you are working on and what part of the challenge you are stuck on.

* Describe the output you are expecting and the output you are experiencing. Saying, "it doesn't work" won't provide any clues to what may be going on.

* Describe your process. What have you done so far in attempt to fix the problem? This will help narrow down the issue. It is also a good opportunity to practice your programming vocabulary.

**Asking good questions is a skill and it takes practice to be proficient!**
