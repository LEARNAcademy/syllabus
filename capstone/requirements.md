  - Look at [previous capstone projects](https://github.com/LEARNAcademy/capstone-projects) for inspiration.
- Step out of your comfort zone.
- Work with everyone in your group.
- Work on a feature or part of the application youâ€™re not completely comfortable with.
- Organization and clear communication is the key to a successful team experience.
- Make sure everyone contributes and feels included.

### Project Demos

- No one will notice your bugs if you don't point them out.
- Use "we" rather than "I" statements as this was a team project.
- Please practice your demo and **stay within the 10 minute time limit**.
- The audience doesn't know the demo format so provide context.
