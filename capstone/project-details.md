### Team Name
Your team name will not be the same as your app name, so get creative!

### Elevator Pitch
The elevator pitch should succinctly explain your project's purpose and functionality.

### Wireframes
Wireframes are drawings or basic outlines of what each page of your application will look to the user. Wireframes should be vague enough that style choices are not limited, but provide enough information to create an MVP. During development, if there are any questions or disagreements on the look or basic functionality of your app, wireframes can help sort out those issues. A good wireframe will allow the development team to "walk through" the application page by page.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a great tool for wireframing!

### DB Schema
Setting up your database will be one of the first steps in your project. The database schema should be drawn out with the name of each column and the data type of each column. Relationships between each table should be defined.

### User Stories
A user story describes how a user interacts with an app. Stories take your wireframes and DB schema and turn them into actionable items. Stories are a detailed "to do" list for every part of your application. Stories keep the team focused on the overall goal of the application as well as keeping the individual developers on task. There should be a clear understanding of when a story is "done".

### Schedules
The capstone project is two weeks long and can be divided into two one-week (5 day) sprints. The first sprint is getting the basic functionality of your application, or your **Minimum Viable Product**. The second sprint is for adding additional styling and **Icebox** functionality.

```
