# Capstone Project Timeline and Workflow

### Week 9: Elevator Pitch, Wireframes, DB Schema
**Planning is critical to the success of your project.** Proper planning can help avoid wasting time and ensure your team is on the same page.

This week you will get your group assignments for the Capstone project and start doing the prework for the application. We recommend creating a shared gmail address that can be used for creating group accounts. Create a Google doc where everyone can offer ideas during the brainstorming process.

You will get together with your group periodically for planning sessions. During these sessions, you will come up with an **elevator pitch** for your project. The pitch should succinctly explain your project's purpose and functionality.

**Wireframes** are drawings or basic outlines of what each page of your application will look to the user. Wireframes should be vague enough that style choices are not limited, but provide enough information to create an MVP. During development, if there are any questions or disagreements on the look or basic functionality of your app, wireframes can help sort out those issues. A good wireframe will allow the development team to "walk through" the application page by page.

Setting up your **database** will be one of the first steps in your project. It is a good idea to draw out your database schema and define the relationships of each table.


**Stories** take your wireframes and DB schema and turn them into actionable items. Stories are a detailed "to do" list for every part of your application. Stories keep the team focused on the overall goal of the application as well as keeping the individual developers on task.

### Week 10: Coding the MVP
The capstone project is two weeks long and can be divided into two one-week sprints. The first sprint is getting the basic functionality of your application, or your **Minimum Viable Product**.

We recommend mobbing the initial set up so the team starts out on the same page.

**A Day in the Life**  
Each team should define a schedule and hold each other accountable to stick with the plan. Here is an example of a daily schedule.

9:15 - Morning standup with the class
- Project manager shares what tasks did the team completes yesterday and what task is the team planning to work on today.
- Tech manager share any blockers you team has and the team's plan for the mentorship session.


9:30 - Check in with your group and discuss the plan for the day
- What story is each person working on?
- What is the goal for the day?
- What story / branch are you currently working on?

9:30 - Pair up and start coding, remember to take breaks regularly and take breaks at the same time

12:00 - Lunch

1:00 - Coding

4:15 - Wrap up with your group

- Design manager shares the current status of the user experience.


4:45 - Check out with the class

**MVP Complete and Retro**  
By the end of the day, you should have your MVP complete. This is the end of your first sprint.

The end of your sprint is an opportunity to reflect on the experience with a **retro**. What went well? What could have been better? What did you learn? What do you want to improve for the next sprint?

### Week 11: Icebox

**Sprint Planning**  
Now that your group has completed your basic functionality, it is time to break into the icebox. The icebox is where all the extra challenges and specialized features live. Discuss with your group which features are most import to your application and to your learning. These features will define your goals for the second sprint.

### Week 12: Demo
It's time to show off your hard work!
