# Agile Development Process

(WIP)

## Vocabulary
- Pull request (PR) - a public request to merge a feature branch back into the main branch
- Stories/features/cards - these can be used interchangeably, represents one
- MVP - Minimum Viable Product


## Features
A feature should represent all the things needed for the user.


## Project Management Board
- The combo is the one list
- Ice box (this is okay to be a hot mess, this is where you just get everything out of your head)
- Backlog - not what you are going to do next, this is what is the next most important thing, this list is prioritized
- Current - only what people are actually working on



## Git Flow

Git flow and branches relating to Stories



Main(master) branch has working code only
Each feature has a branch
Don't branch features off of features, just branch from the main branch
