# Portfolio Site Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to get practice with routing between different components in React using the react-router library.

## User stories

- As a potential client, when I visit your site, I can see an About Me page with your name and information
- As a potential client, I can see a link to your Skills page
- When I click the Skills link, I am taken to a page that lists and describes your skills
- As a potential client, I can see a link to your Projects page
- When I click the Projects link, I am taken to a page with links to your projects
- When I click a project link, I am taken to a detail page about that project
- As a potential client, I can see a link to your Contact Me page
- When I click the Contact Me link, I am taken to a page with your contact information

Note: While building your routes and components, make mental note of what you are importing from react-router and consider the role each one plays.
